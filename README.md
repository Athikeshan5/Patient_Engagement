**Patient engagement platform:**

This project is a Patient Health Information Form that allows patients to fill out their personal and medical details. It is an interactive web-based form, guiding the user to input their health information such as blood pressure, allergies, medical history, and lifestyle details. The form dynamically shows/hides fields based on user responses, improving the overall user experience.

The form is divided into multiple sections:

Personal Information
Medical History
Family Medical History
Lifestyle Information
The form is designed with a clean, responsive layout to ensure usability on both desktop and mobile devices.

**voice to text format:**

This project is a Real-Time Voice-to-Text Application that captures audio input from a microphone and converts it to text using Google's SpeechRecognition API. The project uses Python and the SpeechRecognition library to interact with pre-trained voice-to-text models, enabling real-time speech recognition. The application continuously listens to the microphone and prints recognized text, making it ideal for tasks like transcription, voice commands, or further machine learning-based processing.

Technologies Used
Python 3.x: The primary programming language used for implementing the solution.
SpeechRecognition Library: Provides a simple interface for using different speech recognition engines and APIs like Google’s Speech API.
PyAudio Library: Allows capturing real-time audio from the microphone.

Features
Real-time Speech-to-Text Conversion:

The application continuously listens to the microphone input and converts spoken words into text.
Pre-trained Model Integration:

Leverages Google’s pre-trained SpeechRecognition API for accurate speech-to-text conversion.
Dynamic Noise Adjustment:

The application automatically adjusts to ambient noise for better accuracy, ensuring reliable transcription even in slightly noisy environments.
Error Handling:

Built-in error handling for unknown speech and connectivity issues with the Google API.
